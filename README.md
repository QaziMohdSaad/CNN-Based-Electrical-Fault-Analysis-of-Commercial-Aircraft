# CNN-Based-Electrical-Fault-Analysis-of-Commercial-Aircraft
In this reprository I am going to show my M.Tech Dissertation work whose title was " Artificial Inteeligence Based electrial Fault Analysis of Commercial Aircrfat
# Problem Formulation:
Ensuring safe and efficient flights is dependent upon the reliable operation of electrical systems in commercial aircraft, as aviation safety is of utmost importance. Within this framework, Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications offer a potential fruitful path toward improving the electrical fault diagnostic procedure in commercial aircraft.
# Objectives:
•	Based on information gathered from onboard sensors, the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model is used in commercial aircraft for electrical defect diagnostic.
•	Create, train and assess the suggested AI-based fault analysis system using the MATLAB.
# proposed work flow approach:
1) ADAPT Simulink Model: Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics Testbed (ADAPT) is NASA Ames Research Centre.
